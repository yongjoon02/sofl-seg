FINDINGS:
Left main coronary artery (LM): Patent without significant stenosis.
Left anterior descending artery (LAD): Proximal 70% stenosis with diffuse mid-vessel atherosclerotic disease; distal LAD has reduced opacification.
Left circumflex artery (LCx): Mild (30%) stenosis in the mid segment; obtuse marginal branches are patent.
Right coronary artery (RCA): Chronic total occlusion in the mid segment with collateral filling from LAD; distal RCA is faintly visualized.
TIMI flow: LAD TIMI 2; LCx TIMI 3; RCA TIMI 0.
Catheter/guidewire overlap is present in the proximal RCA projection.
No evidence of coronary aneurysm.

IMPRESSION:
Severe proximal LAD stenosis with reduced distal flow.
Chronic total occlusion of mid RCA with collateral filling.
Mild LCx disease.
